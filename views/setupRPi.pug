  p On Linux desktop computer, download the latest Raspberry Pi image at: 
    a(href='https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest', target='_blank') https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest
    br
    | The downloaded file will have a name like 
    b YYYY-MM-DD-raspbian-stretch.zip
    br 
    | Where YYYY-MM-DD is the year, month, and date of the release. Change directory to the location of the downloaded file and unzip it:
    br 
    code unzip YYYY-MM-DD-raspbian-stretch.zip
    br
    | Before you insert an SD card into your computer identify the names of the drives on your computer by typing:
    br
    code  df -h
    br
    | You will see something similar to the screenshot below:
    br
    a(href='/img/tutorial/screenBeforeSD.png',target='_blank')
      img(src='/img/tutorial/screenBeforeSD.png', height='200px')
    br
    | Now, insert an 8GB (or greater) SD card into your computer. Type:
    br
    code  df -h
    br
    | to determine the name of the SD card
    br
    a(href='/img/tutorial/screenAfterSD.png',target='_blank')
      img(src='/img/tutorial/screenAfterSD.png', height='200px')
    br
    | In this example the name of the SD card is mmcblk0  (p1 is the partition).
    | Copy the disk image 
    b 2018-04-18-raspbian-stretch.img 
    | to the SD card
    br
    code sudo dd if=YYYY-MM-DD-raspbian-stretch of=/dev/SD-CARD-NAME bs=1M
    br
    | Where in this example 
    b SD-CARD-NAME 
    | is mmcblk0. Once the disk copy is complete, eject the disk and re-insert the disk. 
    | You should see two partitions show up on your linux desktop. 
    | The RaspberryPi image now comes with SSH disabled. 
    | To enable it, open the boot partition of the sd card and create a file named ssh. 
    | From a linux terminal on your desktop computer enter:
    br
    code sudo nano /media/$USER/boot/ssh
    br
    | Type a couple of characters and save 
    i (cntrl-x). 
    | For the 
    b Raspberry Pi Zero
    | , there is no ethernet connection so you need to give 
    | it the information to connect to your wireless network. Edit the 
    b wpa_supplicant.conf
    |  file  
    | on the rootfs partition of the sd card. From a linux terminal on your desktop computer enter:
    br
    code sudo nano /media/$USER/rootfs/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    br
    | Add the following lines to the file where 
    i your-wireless-ssid

  p Eject the sd card and place it into the Raspberry-Pi. 
    | Connect the Raspberry Pi with an ethernet cable to your router and then power up the raspberry pi. 
    | Open a linux terminal and ssh into the RaspberryPi:
    br
    code ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
    br
    | The default password for the Raspberry-Pi is 
    b
      i raspberry  
    | . We will want to change this immediately. 
    | Now configure the Raspberry-Pi by running the configuration program:
    br
    code sudo raspi-config
    br
    | The 
    b raspi-config 
    | program looks as below:
    br

      img(src='/img/tutorial/raspi_config.png', height='200px')
    ul
      li First change the password - Menu Iterm 1
      li Under Menu Item 2, change the hostname. Do not set up the wifi, we will do that later
      li Under Item 5, Enable both SSH (P2) and VNC (P3). We will need VNC later
      li Under Item 7, set the screen resolution (for the VNC server)  - Choice A5. I prefer
        b
          i  DMT Mode 35 1280x1024 60Hz 5:4

    a(href='https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/linux/', target='_blank') https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/linux/
    br
    | We will now connect to the RaspberryPi desktop. 
    | It is easy to finish the rest of the configuration from the RaspberryPi Desktop 
    | and the VNC Viewer will allow you to run programs such as the Arduino 
    | programing environment on the RaspberryPi. 
    | Open the VNC viewer and make a New Connection under the File menu. Change the VNC server to: 
    b
      i hostname.local:5900 
    | where hostname is what you entered in Item 2 of the raspi-config program. 
    | Close the new connection dialog and double click on your new connection in the VNC Viewer window. 
    | The VNC viewer should connect to the RaspberryPi. At first it will warn you of an identity check. 
    | Just click continue. Next you will be asked for a username and password. 
    | The username is pi. The password is the password you entered in Item 2 of the raspi-config program.
    | You should see a window as below:
    br
    a(href='/img/tutorial/raspiDesktop.png',target='_blank')
      img(src='/img/tutorial/raspiDesktop.png', height='200px')
    br
    | The wireless connection can be setup by clicking on the Up-Down arrow icon in the upper righthand corner of the desktop. 
    | A nice GUI version of the configuration program can be found under the Preferences sub-menu of Raspberry menu.

  p 
    i
      | Note: it is not necessary to setup an MQTT broker on a Blinky-Lite Device Adapter or web application server. This section is for users who want to set-up their own MQTT broker. However, it does not hurt to have an MQTT broker running on any of your Raspberry-Pi’s so I usually install one as the base configuration of all my Raspberry Pi’s. 
  p
    | Their are many open source MQTT brokers 
    a(href='https://diyprojects.io/mqtt-mosquitto-communicating-connected-objects-iot/', target='_blank') available 
    | but Blinky-Lite will use Mosquitto supported by the 
    a(href='http://iot.eclipse.org/', target='_blank') Eclipse Foundation. 
    | Open a terminal session into your Raspberry-Pi either through an ssh session from your 
    | Linux desktop RealVNC  Connection. Once you have a terminal session running on your 
    | Raspberry-Pi, install Mosquitto by typing:
    br
    code sudo apt-get install mosquitto
    br
    | To run tests on your Raspberry, using  mosquitto_sub clients (to subscribe), 
    | mosquitto_pub (to post messages) and mosquitto_passwd (to set up users and passwords) enter:
    br
    code sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
    br
    | Then edit the mosquitto configuration file
    br
    code sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
    br
    | by addingto the bottom of the file:
    br
    code allow_anonymous false
    br
    code password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
    br
    | and save and exit (
    i Ctrl-x
    | ). Now setup the password for the MQTT broker:
    br
    code sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile 
      i broker-name
    br
    | I usually choose the hostname of the Raspberry-Pi as the broker name. 
    | The program will ask you for the a password for your broker. 
    | After you have chosen the password, reboot your Raspberry-Pi:
    br
    code sudo reboot
    br 
    | The Mosquitto MQTT broker should start on boot. When the Raspberry-Pi comes back up, 
    | login and check that the MQTT broker is running by typing at the terminal:
    br
    code ps -aux | grep mosquitto
    br
    | You should see an output looking something like:
    br
    code mosquit+ 302 0.3 1.0 8228 4500 ?     S  07:41 0:00 /usr/sbin/mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
    br
    | But the process numbers will be different. Now test the MQTT broker by subscribing to a topic:
    br
    code mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1  -t chit/chat -u 
      i broker-name 
      | -P 
      i broker-password
    br
    | where:
    ul
      li 
        b -h 
        | is the IP address of the broker (which is 127.0.0.1 right now since we are testing the 
        | example locally on the broker). 
        | Note that if your Raspberry-Pi is behind a firewall and you want to access the broker 
        | from outside the firewall (which you usually do):
        ul
          li you will need to setup up port forwarding on your home router. 
          li You will need to consult the manual for your router to do that.
          li The Port Number for the MQTT broker is the default 1883
      li
        b -t 
        |  is the topic you wish to subscribe to (chit/chat in this example)
      li
        b -u 
        | is the broker name you chose for the MQTT broker previously
      li
        b -P 
        | is the password of the MQTT broker
    | The program will now wait for messages. In another terminal window, login to the Raspberry-Pi and enter:
    br
    code mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t chit/chat -m "Hi There" -u 
      i broker-name 
      | -P 
      i broker-password
    br
    | Where -m is the message you would like to send to the broker 
    | (“Hi There” in this example). You should see in the terminal running mosquitto_sub the message echoed. 
    | Congratulations! You now have a function MQTT broker. You can exit the mosquitto_sub program by typing 
    i ctrl-c
